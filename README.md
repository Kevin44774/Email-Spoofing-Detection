# Email-Spoofing-Detection
* An advanced email spoofing detection system using machine learning for text-based spam filtering. 
* By employing CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, and various machine learning models including logistic regression, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines (SVC), incoming messages are analyzed for their likelihood of being spam.
* The system processes and categorizes these messages to ensure that only non-spam content reaches users' inboxes, providing a robust defense against unwanted communication and email spoofing. 

## Tools 
* Google Colab for Model Training
* VS Code for Website deployment
